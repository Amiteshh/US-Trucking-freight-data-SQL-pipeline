# US-Trucking-freight-data-SQL-pipeline
This project analyzes U.S. trucking freight shipment data to uncover insights into cost efficiency, carrier performance, and route optimization. The dataset is modeled to reflect real-world logistics operations, including shipments, carriers, and locations. Using SQL relational database, I wrote analytical queries, and designed performance metrics

## Overview
This project analyzes **U.S. trucking freight shipment data** to uncover insights on cost efficiency, carrier performance, and route optimization.  
It models the logistics and transportation domain — similar to operations at **Uber Freight** and **FedEx** — and uses SQL to explore large-scale shipping trends.

The goal is to demonstrate **data engineering, SQL analytics, and business intelligence** skills by transforming raw freight data into actionable insights.

## Objectives
- Build a **normalized SQL database** to store shipments, carriers, and locations.  
- Use **advanced SQL** (joins, CTEs, window functions) to uncover operational patterns.  
- Calculate logistics KPIs such as:
  - Cost per mile  
  - On-time delivery rate  
  - Average transit days  
  - Lane efficiency metrics  
- Identify **outliers and optimization opportunities** across freight lanes.  
- Create datasets ready for machine learning and forecasting use cases.
